PLEASE NOTE: 
-Only three commits were made for this assignment. The initial commit, the finalisation of assignment commit & the readme commit. Apologies for not having more.
-Admittedly the webpage has had no formatting done, so when selecting an id, the charts will be stacked on top of each other. (Rest assured, I will provide myself more time to do this properly for future assignments and projects).
-The additional (bonus) visualisation is unfortunately not included in this assignment. 

PLEASE FIND ATTACHED:

app.js in: 'Starter_Code' > 'static' > 'js' > 'app.js'
assignment javascript code, accomodated with comments & justifying notes throughout the code.

All other associated files within the submission file were pre loaded with necessary code or information to acommodate the assignment, no personal changes have been made to any of these files.
All code relevant to the assignment are within 'app.js'

I hope the way I submitted the assignment suffices to the criteria, admittedly have some confusion in how it needed to be submitted.
